# Zwift Workouts

Apart from being fun to ride, [Zwift](http://zwift.com) offers a compelling experience for cyclists wishing to ride intervals indoors. It comes with a great set of workouts built-in, and this collection includes variants of those which fit your author's personal preferences:

1. Trades graduated, ramped warmups for discrete intervals.
1. Breaks up longer intervals into shorter, back-to-back chunks.
  - Defeats Zwift's distracting “Pain-o-Vision”.
  - Aids mental games by offering milestones.
1. Replaces strict targets with free rides for rest intervals.
1. Uses exact percentages rather than approximates.
  - Zwift's editor sets, for example, 1.1999 instead of 1.20.
1. Names workouts exactly according to their structure.
  - Because your author is a nerd.
